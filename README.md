## standalone scripts
- tmpfs mode only!
- you can put this onto post-fs-data of modules that you want globally mounted.
- heavily commented, read them.
- do not put me as another author on your modules using this!
  - this is on The Unlicensed, no attribution needed.
  - I don't want to get blamed for module issues.
