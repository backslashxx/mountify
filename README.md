## standalone script
- this is only meant for KernelSU OverlayFS
- you can put this onto post-fs-data of modules that you want globally mounted.
- heavily commented, read them.
- do not put me as another author on your modules using this!
  - this is on The Unlicensed, no attribution needed.
  - I don't want to get blamed for module issues.

### NOTE: this is no longer relevant after KernelSU 22098.
- this is kept for reference purposes and a deprecation notice.
